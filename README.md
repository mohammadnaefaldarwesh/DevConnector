HYF class20 project

####

- the most changes witch i made just to make the code cleaner and more dry.

- I put the functions witch were in the api file in separated files.

- I make some functions witch we can use it many times so we don't repeat our codes.

- I remove the unlike route and add it to like route so the same route will do the like and unlike ....I did that because i think we don't need two routes to do this functionality...and i think it is better in front end to have one button to toggle the like and unlike .
